Exercise 1:

What does the PCA plot suggest to you about the data? Why?

The 3 biological replicates from the same tissue mostly cluster together, as expected since they come from the same tissue source.
One notable exception is the ambiguous clustering of the Fe and LFC.Fe replicates close together, which could be explained by the
close proximity of these regions in the gut.

What feature explains the first principal component (simply saying “tissue” is not sufficient)?

PC1 one seems to explain the position of the portion of the gut along the length of the midgut region. More negative values correspond to samples
collected closer to anterior portion of the gut, closer to the proventriculus, whereas more positive values correspond to samples collected from
more posterior regions.

Exercise 3:

Do the categories of enrichments make sense? Why?

Given the source of the tissues from the Drosophila gut, the gene enrichments make sense for both clusters. In cluster A, I observed GO terms indicating enrichment for genes involved in "epithelial cell development" and "epithelial cell differentiation" that would make sense given
the critical importance of gut epithelia in maintaining homeostasis. Cluster B is enriched for a lot of genes involved in transmembrane transport.
This enrichment does not seem particularly gut specific.
